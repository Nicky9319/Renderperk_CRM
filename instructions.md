We have build a renderfarm named Renderperk and we use GPU in it to do rendering for people themselves 
which makes their work quicker and cheaper

we currently only support to work with blender but open for opportunities for other sotwares too and hence it would be 
great if specify blender and seek as potential helpers for people not directly using blender snd all


Your job role is to,

1. List down all the user names and even the reddit url for that user itself you find in the thread itself which can be used to uniquely idetify the user and then also mention their role in this conversational thread.

Need to add the users found in the user-names.json file itself.



2. Find out the relevant context for the initial conversation and find out the relevant comments at the relevant places that I can make to intitial meaning full conversation and even to provide value so that my activity on reddit increases and all

Make sure to put the reddit url itself 
Also write down the reason for that comments and all under the json record itself
Make sure that it is humane and it is something that looks humane to read for that maybe try including some humane language and spelling erros and all

Need to add the ideas in the ideas.json file itself
Make sure to link to the correct reddit url for the idea 
Add proper context in respective json record for the same.


4. Do competion analysis figure out the render famrs which people are talking about 

In the json file make a record for all the unique render farms names found in it
for competetor record stores the positives the users are saying the negative users are saying
Store all the relevant context found regarding them (How they Market, Scale, potential bottlenecks, business execution etc...)
also make sure to having a counter so that we can have data about how many people are syaing the same thing

eg. it has a great UI and a lot of people have the same intent then make sure to have some metadata stored of how many people are saying that and all
(Add we need to do this for all the pros and cons for the platform or the renderfarm found)
