# Image Asset Descriptions and Tags

This file describes the 4 images referenced in the blog outline. Keep images consistent in style (clean infographic/flat design with subtle gradients) to match technical content and make charts easy to read.

IMG1 — Hero infographic: "Local vs Cloud Timeline & Cost"
- Description: A horizontal timeline comparing two workflows side-by-side. Left side: "Local Rendering" showing a desktop tower icon, calendar icon spanning 14 days, and a cost tag "$400+". Right side: "Cloud GPU Rendering" showing stacked server/GPU icons, a clock showing ~7 hours, and a cost tag "$300–500". Center top: a bold headline: "2 Weeks vs 7 Hours — What’s the Real Cost?".
- Purpose: Immediate visual hook showing the time and cost gap.
- Style: Clean vector infographic, muted colors, clear labels, 16:9 hero aspect ratio.
- Tags: `render farm`, `cloud rendering`, `local rendering`, `timeline`, `cost comparison`, `render time`

IMG2 — GPU vs CPU Cost Visualization
- Description: Dual bar chart comparing project completion time and total project cost for CPU vs GPU. Two grouped bars per category: "Time to Complete" and "Total Cost", with GPU bars dramatically shorter/lower. Include annotations like "5–15x faster" and "10–50x cheaper overall".
- Purpose: Visual proof of GPU advantage.
- Style: Simple chart, accessible colors, PNG/SVG.
- Tags: `gpu vs cpu`, `cost comparison`, `bar chart`, `render time`, `rendering costs`

IMG3 — Bar chart: Project Cost GPU vs CPU
- Description: Single bar chart showing concrete example numbers for the OP's scene (10,080 frames): CPU total cost (~$322), GPU total cost (~$120), and GPU with buffer/priority (~$320). Bars labeled and color-coded.
- Purpose: Reinforce the worked example with numbers.
- Style: Minimal labels, numeric callouts, high-contrast colors.
- Tags: `cost breakdown`, `example`, `render farm`, `gpu`, `cpu`

IMG4 — Optimization Techniques Flow Diagram
- Description: Flow diagram with central node "Optimization Techniques" branching to 8 nodes: Scene Optimization, AI Upscaling, Frame Interpolation, Priority Strategy, Sample-Based Optimization, Regional Timing, Membership Discounts, Monitoring & Early Fixes. Each node shows an expected savings percentage bubble.
- Purpose: Quick reference for readers to choose optimizations.
- Style: Diagram/illustration, visually consistent with other images.
- Tags: `optimization`, `ai upscaling`, `scene optimization`, `cost savings`, `render farm tips`

Notes:
- Limit images to 3–4. Prefer vector/SVG charts for crispness.
- Ensure alt text is used when embedding images for accessibility (use short descriptions from above).
