Intent / Objective
- Provide a hands-on, actionable guide and simple calculator that helps 3D artists estimate render farm costs quickly using a few measured inputs.

Target Audience
- 3D artists and freelancers who need quick cost estimates for animations or large render jobs, especially those new to render farms.

Key Points to Cover
- Why measuring a representative frame is crucial
- Pricing models explained (per-core-hour, per-GPU-hour, per-minute, per-frame)
- Step-by-step calculator formula with worked examples
- Buffering for test renders and retries (25–50%)
- Non-compute cost traps: license, uploads, priority, storage
- Optimization strategies to reduce costs (AI upscaling, frame interpolation, scene cleanup)

Interesting Facts / Hooks
- Case study: 10,080 frames at 2 min/frame = 336 compute-hours — show how GPU speedups can shrink that dramatically
- Show a sensitivity comparison: low-rate/high-speedup vs high-rate/low-speedup produce very different bills
- Mention real-world anecdotes: people saved 60–80% by using GPU farms or AI upscaling in some threads

Suggested CTA
- "Try our free render cost calculator" with a link to an interactive spreadsheet/tool and an option to get a custom quote from Renderperk.
