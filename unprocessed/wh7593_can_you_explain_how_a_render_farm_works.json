So if I have for\nArguments sake 520 frames of an animation, and for argument sake let’s say I’ve tested it and each frame takes exactly one minute to render. So on my system at home that’s going to take 520 minutes to render it all. But if I use all the render farms 520 GPUs at the same time and it still takes a minute to render at their end, then am I right it saying that I will have all 520 frames rendered in a minute? but what will it cost me? Am I renting the GPUs by the hour? Even though I only used them for a minute? Or is it that I would not pay 0.50 per GPU (as that would cost me $260 bucks) or would you calculate how long I technically used the 520 GPUs for, which I’m guessing would be $0.50 divided by 60 (60 minutes) times by 520 GPUs which works out as $4.03\n\nThanks in advance! \n\nS",

Here’s a simple breakdown:\n\nWhen you use a **render farm**, you’re basically *renting GPU power by the hour*.

You pay only for the time you actually use, can run multiple frames simultaneously, and even install your own Blender or rendering tools directly on the node.\n\nIt’s one of the easiest ways to understand render costs in real time since you control the machine like it’s your own.",
