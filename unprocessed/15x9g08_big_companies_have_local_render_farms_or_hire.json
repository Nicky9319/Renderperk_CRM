See, im a vfx artist and always worked in smaller companies where teams are always of 3 or 4 persons dealing with the CG department to make 3D renders for shots. So lately I found my self with the same issue again and again and its that the bosses in this small vfx companies never invest much money in stuff like render farms or good computers. Just the minimum to pull out shots and thats it, which is very frustrating. We are always having  rendering issues and very short timed deadlines with hardware that gives minimum requirements. The thing is, that when I started speaking my mind about thi to my boss, he always says \" big companies also use our systems\" meaning that they hire external renderfarms who take care of their renders. I believe that thats not true, like, they have local renderfarms, a bunch of computers only set to render their projects. I feel that my boss always gasslights me with this and its the fault of the 3d department and not the fact that we dont have resources. ...sorry for the blabing. MY QUESTION IS:\n\nDo big companies rely only on renderfarm services or do they have a local internal renderfarm for them selfes to pull out shots?",
